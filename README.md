## About 



hello there\
In this repository I tried to create api of educational website.\
My focus has been on apis.\
This api creates, edits or deletes users.\
Some tasks are on the admin's shoulders.\
If a user has an admin flag in the system, he can create a course and add parts of the courses to the courses.


Users can post their comments under the courses and view the courses.
