## About 



hello there 
In this repository I tried to create api of educational website\

My focus has been on apis

This api creates, edits or deletes users

Some tasks are on the admin's shoulders

If a user has an admin flag in the system, he can create a course and add parts of the courses to the courses

Update, delete or create courses

Users can post their comments under the courses and view the courses
Course data:
