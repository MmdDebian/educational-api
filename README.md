## About 



hello there\
In this repository I tried to create api of educational website.\
My focus has been on apis.\
This api creates, edits or deletes users.\
Some tasks are on the admin's shoulders.\
If a user has an admin flag in the system, he can create a course and add parts of the courses to the courses.\
Users can post their comments under the courses and view the courses.

Course data :\

### Implemented endpoints:
>note: APIs start with the /api path (for Example : /api/auth/register )
#### /auth 
Path | Method | Description
---|---|--- 
/api/auth/register | port | register Action
